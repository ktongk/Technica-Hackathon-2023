# Technica-Hackathon-2023
Stock-ify aims to aid underrepresented groups in learning the stock market in a fast, approachable way.

# How-it-works
The app works by giving the user a randomly generated sum of anywhere between $5,000 to $25,000 as your "income" or spendable amount. They are then directed to an info page complete with informatics
and charts that aims to help the user learn stock market trends. They are calculated based around randomly generated amounts with each stock having a stock price range. For example, Apple's stock price 
can only be in the range $200-$800. A dataframe will be generated for seven days based on these ranges for our chosen companies. We only use 6 companies as to not overload the user. From there, the user 
can choose three stocks they think will earn them money and how many shares of each stock they want to buy. Our simulation will take over the work from there and output how much the user spent, lost, 
and their total at the end!
